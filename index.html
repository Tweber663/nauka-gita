    <h1>Man's Not Hot</h1>
    <h3>By BIG SHAQ </h3>
    <p>
        Yo, Big Shaq, the one and only
        Man's not hot, never hot
        Skrrat (GottiOnEm), skidi-kat-kat
        Boom
        Two plus two is four
        Minus one that's three, quick maths
        Everyday man's on the block
        Smoke trees (Ah)
        See your girl in the park
        That girl is a uckers
        When the ting went quack-quack-quack
        You man were ducking (You man ducked)
        Hold tight, Asznee (My brudda)
        He's got the pumpy (Big ting)
        Hold tight, my man (My guy)
